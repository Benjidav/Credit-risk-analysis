# Credit-risk-analysis

Credit risk analysis consists in the evaluation of the likelihood of a counterpart
to respects its obligations (payment installments and deadlines).
Different techniques are available in literature to evaluate the creditworthness of a
counterpart, by estimate three main parameters : Exposure at Default (EAD), Loss given
Default (LGD) and Probability of Default (PD).
Purpose of this project is -at first- to analyse the techniques currently employed and available
in literature for credit risk analysis, and -at a subsequent stage- to propose and implement an
enhanced technique -by leveraging on those already defined
